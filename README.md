# Cpptris

Multiplayer/networked Tetris clone written in C++ using SFML

## Features

1. Classic tetris gameplay
2. Levels and score streaks
3. Networked multiplayer for up to 4 players!

## Why?

Created as a quick hobby project to learn C++ coming from C.

Contains some hacky solutions and is quite non-scalable as a result. Memory leaks? Yes please.
For this project I focused more on getting stuff to work in C++ rather than making them pretty!

## Can I use this?

All code is released under the MIT license. Feel free to look around if you're interested in learning C++ as well.
You can use the code for whatever you want!
